Noelle C             I liked it. It wasn't horribly gruesome and the story was pretty good
3 stars.             considering the challenges of making a Spiderman villain without spiderman. I
October 17, 2018     thought Eddie was a bit too NEW YORK and San Francisco was a little too clean
                     and not filled with weirdos to be realistic, but if I think of it like a
                     cartoon, it was perfect.

Chris S              Saw this last night, and enjoyed it very much. Not sure why the critics loathe
4 stars.             it so bad. It's an anti-hero movie. The interaction between Venom and Brock is
October 17, 2018     hilarious. Tom Hardy plays the broken man very well. There were several moments
                     where the jokes had the entire theater laugh at the same time. The action and
                     pacing of the movie are good. Professional critics are too full of themselves.
                     They expect an action flick to be Oscar level, when literally nobody else does.

Jeremy C             The critics were too hard on the film, very much worth going to see. My dad and
5 stars.             I loved it.
